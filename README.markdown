# ADGM Corporate Agent - AI-Powered Document Compliance System

## Project Overview
The ADGM Corporate Agent is an AI-powered system designed to streamline corporate document processing for Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) compliance. It currently implements document classification with plans to expand into a full compliance analysis workflow.

## Features
- **Document Classification**: Scans and classifies uploaded DOCX files, checking for completeness against required ADGM documents.
- **Content Analysis**: Extracts key content (first 10 paragraphs) for AI-driven classification.
- **Completeness Scoring**: Calculates the percentage of required documents present (e.g., 83.33% for 5/6 documents).
- **Error Handling**: Robust handling of file processing errors.
- **Output**: Generates structured reports identifying present and missing documents, such as Articles of Association, Memorandum of Association, Board Resolution, Register of Members, Register of Directors, and Incorporation Application.

## Tech Stack
- **CrewAI**: Multi-agent orchestration and workflow management.
- **LangChain**: Planned for RAG implementation and LLM integration.
- **python-docx**: DOCX file parsing and content extraction.
- **Groq/OpenAI**: Large Language Models for document analysis.
- **Python**: Core development language.

## Current Implementation
### Document Classifier Agent
- **Tool**: `ADGMDocumentClassifierTool`
- **Functionality**:
  - Scans `/documents` directory for DOCX files.
  - Extracts content and headers.
  - Performs AI-powered classification using Groq LLM (`llama-3.1-8b-instant`).
  - Validates required ADGM documents.
  - Generates structured reports with completeness scores and missing document analysis.
- **Example Output**:
  ```
  ✅ Classified Documents: 5/6 documents (83.33% complete)
  ✅ Present: Articles of Association, Memorandum, Board Resolution, Register of Members, Register of Directors
  ❌ Missing: Incorporation Application
  🎯 Status: Not ready for submission
  ```

## Planned Features
### RAG-Powered Compliance Analysis
- **LangChain RAG Integration**:
  - **Knowledge Base**: ADGM Companies Regulations 2020, Branch Registration Requirements.
  - **Vector Store**: Embeddings of regulatory documents for semantic search.
  - **Dynamic Retrieval**: Context-aware regulation retrieval based on document type.
  - **Citation Backing**: Links compliance issues to specific ADGM regulations.
- **Red-Flag Analyzer Agent**:
  - Jurisdiction validation (ADGM vs. UAE Federal court references).
  - Registered office compliance (ADGM boundary requirements).
  - Signature requirements (execution and authorization validation).
  - Beneficial ownership (UBO disclosure checks).
  - Template compliance (matching ADGM standard forms).
- **Document Editor Agent**:
  - Automated clause suggestions for compliance.
  - Inline comments for identified issues.
  - Template matching to ADGM formats.
  - Regulation-referenced corrections.

- High-confidence classifications ready for compliance analysis.
- Structured output for seamless RAG integration.

## Next Sprint
- Implement LangChain RAG with ADGM regulations.
- Develop Red-Flag Analyzer using RAG-retrieved rules.
- Enable citation-backed compliance reporting.

## Status
- **Document Classification**: ✅ Complete
- **RAG Implementation**: 🔄 In Progress
- **Compliance Analysis**: 📅 Planned
